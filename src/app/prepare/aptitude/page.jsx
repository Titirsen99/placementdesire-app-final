  <p>
    Number System is a method of representing numbers on the number line
    with the help of a set of symbols and rules. These symbols range from
    0-9 and are termed as digits. Let’s learn about the number system in
    detail, including its types, and conversion. Number system in Maths is
    a writing system for expressing numbers. It is a mathematical notation
    for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols
    in a consistent manner. It allows us to perform arithmetic operations
    like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A number
    system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. It is the
    mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using
    digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. It provides a unique
    representation of every number and represents the arithmetic and
    algebraic structure of the figures. It also allows us to operate
    arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
    division.
  </p>

  <p>The value of any digit in a number can be determined by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The digit</li>
    <li>Its position in the number</li>
    <li>The base of the number system</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are various types of number systems in mathematics. The four most common number system types are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Decimal number system (Base- 10)</li>
    <li>Binary number system (Base- 2)</li>
    <li>Octal number system (Base- 8)</li>
    <li>Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16)</li>
  </ol>

        <p>
          The term “Average” describes a value that should represent the sample.
          An average is defined as the sum of all the values divided by the
          total number of values in a given set. It is also known as the
          arithmetic mean. Let us consider simple data to find the average.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given, the set of values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Average = Sum of all the
          values/ Total number of values Average = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5)/5 = 15/5 =

      <div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
        <p>
          The full form of LCM in Maths is the Least Common Multiple, whereas
          the full form of HCF is the Highest Common Factor. The H.C.F. defines
          the greatest factor present in between given two or more numbers,
          whereas L.C.M. defines the least number which is exactly divisible by
          two or more numbers. H.C.F. is also called the greatest common factor
          (GCF) and LCM is also called the Least Common Divisor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The formula which involves both HCF and LCM is: Product of Two numbers
          = (HCF of the two numbers) x (LCM of the two numbers) Say, A and B are
          the two numbers, then as per the formula; A x B = H.C.F.(A, B) x
          L.C.M.(A, B) We can also write the above formula in terms of HCF and
          LCM, such as: H.C.F. of Two numbers = Product of Two numbers/L.C.M of
          two numbers & L.C.M of two numbers = Product of Two numbers/H.C.F. of
          Two numbers

      <div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
        <p>
          Time and Work is one of the most common quantitative aptitude topics.
          This is one of those topics which candidates are familiar with even
          before they start their competitive exam preparation. The concept of
          time and work remains the same, however, the type of questions asked
          may have a bit of variety. Mostly, 1-2 words problems are asked from
          this topic but candidates must also keep themselves prepared to have
          questions in data sufficiency and data interpretation to be picked up
          from time and work. Time and work deals with the time taken by an
          individual or a group of individuals to complete a piece of work and
          the efficiency of the work done by each of them. Given below are the
          basic type of questions which may be asked in the exam with respect to
          the time and work topic:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To find the efficiency of a person</li>
          <li>To find the time taken by an individual to do a piece of work</li>
          <li>To find the time taken by a group of individuals to complete a piece of work</li>
          <li>Work done by an individual in a certain time duration</li>
          <li>Work done by a group of individuals in a certain time duration</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Mostly the questions asked may involve one of these things to find and
          candidates can use the related formulas to easily get through the
          answers for the same. Important Time and Work Formula
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing the formulas can completely link you to a solution as soon as
          you read the question. Thus, knowing the formula for any numerical
          ability topic make the solution and the related calculations simpler.
          Given below are a few such important time and work formulas for your
          reference:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Work Done = Time Taken × Rate of Work</li>
          <li>Rate of Work = 1 / Time Taken</li>
          <li>Time Taken = 1 / Rate of Work</li>
          <li>If a piece of work is done in x number of days, then the work done in one day = 1/x</li>
          <li>Total Work Done = Number of Days × Efficiency</li>
          <li>Efficiency and Time are inversely proportional to each other</li>
          <li>X:y is the ratio of the number of men which are required to complete a piece of work, then the ratio of the time taken by them to complete the work will be y:x</li>
          <li>If x number of people can do W1 work, in D1 days, working T1 hours each day and the number of people can do W2 work, in D2 days, working T2 hours each day, then the relation between them will be (M1*D1*T1)/W1 = (M2*D2*T2)/W2</li>

      <span className="font-bold text-3xl">5. Ratio and Proportion Test</span>

      <div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
        <p>
          Ratio is used for comparing two quantities of the same kind. The ratio
          formula for two numbers, a and b, is expressed as a : b or a/b. When
          two or more ratios are equal, they are said to be in proportion. The
          concept of ratio and proportion is based on fractions. Ratio and
          proportion are the key foundations for various other concepts in
          Mathematics. Ratio and proportion have their applications in solving
          many day-to-day problems, like when we compare heights, weights,
          distance or time or while adding ingredients in cooking, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is Ratio and Proportion? A comparison of two quantities by
          division is called a ratio, and the equality of two ratios is called
          proportion. A ratio can be written in different forms like x : y or
          x/y and is commonly read as, x is to y. On the other hand, proportion
          is an equation that says that two ratios are equivalent. A proportion
          is written as x : y :: z : w, and is read as x is to y as z is to w.
          Here, x/y = z/w where w & y are not equal to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Definition of Ratio: Ratio is the comparison of two quantities which
          is obtained by dividing the first quantity by the other. If a and b
          are two quantities of the same kind and with the same units, such that
          b is not equal to 0, then the quotient a/b is called the ratio between
          a and b. Ratios are expressed using the symbol of the colon (:). This
          means that ratio a/b has no unit and it can be written as a : b.
        </p>
        <p>
          Definition of Proportion: Proportion refers to the equality of two
          ratios. Two equivalent ratios are always in proportion. Proportions
          are denoted by the symbol (::) and they help us to solve for unknown
          quantities. In other words, proportion is an equation or statement
          that is used to depict that the two ratios or fractions are
          equivalent. Four non-zero quantities, a, b, c, d, are said to be in
          proportion if a : b = c : d.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us consider the two ratios - 3 : 5 and 15 : 25. Here, 3 : 5
          can be expressed as 3:5 = 3/5 = 0.6 and 15:25 can be expressed as
          15:25 = 15/25 = 3/5 = 0.6. Since both the ratios are equal, we can say
          that these two are proportional.
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of proportions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Direct Proportion</li>
          <li>Inverse Proportion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Direct Proportion:</p>
        <p>
          Direct proportion describes the direct relationship between two
          quantities. If one quantity increases, the other quantity also
          increases and vice-versa. Thus, a direct proportion is written as y ∝
          x. For example, if the speed of a car is increased, then it covers
          more distance in a fixed period of time.
        </p>
        <p>Inverse Proportion:</p>
        <p>
          Inverse proportion describes the relationship between two quantities
          in which if one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases and
          vice-versa. Thus, an inverse proportion is written as y ∝ 1/x. For
          example, as the speed of a vehicle is increased, it will cover a fixed
          distance in less time.
        </p>
        <p>Ratio and Proportion Formula:</p>
        <p>
          The formula for ratio is expressed as a : b ⇒ a/b, where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a = the first term or antecedent</li>
          <li>b = the second term or consequent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the ratio 2 : 7 is also represented as 2/7, where 2 is the
          antecedent and 7 is the consequent.

      <div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
        <p>
          In these type of questions, if the two different positions are given
          from the same side (i.e. either both are from the left hand side of
          the alphabet or both are from the right hand side of the alphabet), we
          can simply add up the 2 different positions from the same side, get
          their simple average and thus, the correct answer. In this particular
          case, the two positions are 12 and 20 from the left hand side of the
          alphabet. Adding and then averaging them, we get 16. Recollecting the
          EJOTY formula that we discussed earlier, we come up with the letter
          which is 16th from left side (after O) is P. The same process can be
          applied if we are given a case in which both the positions are counted
          from the right hand side of the alphabet. Remember, the answer we get
          will be from the same from both sides. Let’s make this clearer by
          discussing an illustration.

          items, out of which all except one are similar to one another in some
          manner; candidates should choose this one item that does not fit into
          the given group. Classification and odd one out questions aim to judge
          the candidate’s information processing capabilities, creative thinking
          ability, and evaluation skills. Several prestigious government exams

        <p>
          Solving syllogism aptitude MCQ tests involves using logical reasoning
          to deduce conclusions based on given statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are three important points to keep in mind when solving syllogism
          questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understand Syllogism Basics: Comprehend the structure involving two
            premises and one conclusion. Recognize that conclusions should
            logically follow from the given statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Visual Aids (Venn Diagrams): Utilize Venn diagrams to visualize
            relationships between categories. Draw circles representing
            categories and place elements inside. Valid conclusions are those
            where elements fitting the conclusions category are within the
            circle intersections.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apply Syllogism Rules: Follow standard rules for different cases:
            <ol>
              <li>
                All A are B: Valid conclusion if premise asserts all A are B.
              </li>
              <li>
                No A is B: Valid conclusion if premise states no A is B.

      <div className="font-bold text-3xl">10. Blood Relation Test</div>

<div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
  <p>
    Blood relation forms an important part of the reasoning section in most competitive exams. Blood relation questions show the different relations among the members of a family. Based on the information given, you are required to find the relation between particular members of the family.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples include relations by birth such as mother, father, son, daughter, etc., and relations by marriage such as father-in-law, mother-in-law, etc. Over the years, the standard and type of questions asked from the blood relation topic have evolved. Initially, the questions were less complex and statement or dialogue-based, but with increased competition, the variety of questions has also changed. Given below are the different ways in which blood relation questions may be asked in competitive exams for the assistance of candidates:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dialogue/Conversation Based – In such questions, one person describes his/her relation with another person (this may or may not be related to the person with whom the conversation is being made).</li>
    <li>Based on Puzzles – To make the questions complex, blood relation questions are also being asked in the form of a puzzle. A piece of brief information about multiple people being interrelated is given and sub-questions based on the same may be asked.</li>
    <li>Coding-Decoding – The relationship between two people may be denoted using symbols. This has become a common method of asking blood relation questions in competitive exams nowadays.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are a few things to keep in mind while solving blood relation questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You cannot assume the gender of a person based on the name.</li>
    <li>If the statement says X is the son of Y, the gender of Y cannot be determined unless mentioned in the question.</li>
    <li>In puzzle-based questions, a web of relations can be formed, so do not solve such questions in haste.</li>
    <li>These questions are scoring and easy to solve, so do not panic if the question seems lengthy.</li>
    <li>In the case of coding-decoding blood relations, use a pictorial description to solve the question. This will make the symbols and relationships clearer.</li>
  </ul>

          Coding is a part of the logical reasoning section used to encrypt
          words, numbers in specific patterns or codes using particular rules
          and regulations. Decoding is the process that is used to decrypt the
          patterns into original forms from the given forms. How do you decode
          coding?
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe alphabets or numbers given in the code keenly. Find the
          sequence it follows whether it is ascending or descending. Detect the
          rule in which the alphabets/numbers/words follow. Fill the appropriate
          letter/number/word in the blank given. Coding and Decoding questions,
          as the name suggests, are questions where candidates have to decode a
          condition or a code given in the statement and based on it answer the
          questions.

      <div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
        <p>
          Before we move on to solving questions based on the seating
          arrangement, candidates must go through the brief introduction
          regarding the concept of seating arrangement. In reasoning ability,
          when a piece of information is given about a group of people and the
          manner in which they are seated, such an arrangement is called a
          seating arrangement. This may be a straight line, circular, rectangle,
          or any other arrangement in which people or things are placed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major part of the questions in the reasoning section is picked from
          this concept. Thus, candidates must emphasize on its preparation and
          solve more and more questions based on the same.

      <div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
        <p>
          Assertion and reason is a type of reasoning where a statement and a
          reason are provided from which one has to choose the right one. There
          are two statements in a question – one assertion and one reason. Your
          job is to determine whether these two statements are true and if the
          reason supports the assertion. If you rush through the assertion
          questions, you may not be able to answer it correctly. So, read the
          question carefully to understand the assertion statement. Then, figure
          out whether the reason statement is true or not. Once you feel you
          have found the correct answer, read both the given statements once
          more. Each question consists of two statements,namely,Assertion (A)
          and Reason (R).For selecting the correct answer,use the following
          code: (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are the true and Reason
          (R) is a correct explanation of Assertion (A)

      <span className="font-bold text-3xl">15. Cube and Dice Test</span>

<div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
  <p>
    What Does The Term “Cube” Mean? A cube is a 3-dimensional shape with equal length, breadth, and height, with any two adjoining faces angled at 90° to one another. It is composed of six faces, eight corners, and twelve edges. Because only three sides of a cube can be seen at a time, they’re called “Joint Sides,” and these sides can’t be on the opposite side of each other. Things structured like cubes are frequently referred to as ‘cubic’.
  </p>
  <p>Fundamental Rules: There are many dice principles in reasoning that can be used to answer dice-based problems:</p>
  <ol className="p-3">
    <li>Two dice with opposing faces cannot be adjacent to one another.</li>
    <li>If two dice are arranged as illustrated below, one of 2 common faces (Face 4) is in the same position; the remaining faces will oppose one another.</li>
    <li>If the dice placements are different, but the common face is the same, then the opposing faces of the remaining faces will be the same.</li>
    <li>If two die positions are given, and it is also mentioned that the common face in each place is different, then the face opposing the specified common side would be the face that is not visible on any specified face in any of the two die positions. Additionally, the opposing face of the remaining faces cannot be the same.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cube Dice Formula: The figure above can be deconstructed into three horizontal layers:</p>
  <ul className="p-2">
    <li>Layer I, or the top layer</li>
    <li>Layer II, or the middle layer</li>
    <li>Layer III, or the bottom layer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also, if n = the number of cube face divisions then:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The number of smaller cubes without a painted face equals (n-2)^3.</li>
    <li>The number of smaller cubes with a painted face equals (n-2)^2 x 6.</li>
    <li>The number of smaller cubes painted on two faces equals (n-2) x 12.</li>
    <li>The number of smaller cubes with three painted faces equals eight.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here is an example: A cube with blue paint on its face is divided into 125 equal-sized cubes. Now answer these questions:</p>
  <ul className="p-2">
    <li>(a) 8</li>
    <li>(b) 16</li>
    <li>(c) 18</li>
    <li>(d) 27</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How many cubes can you see to be painted on a single side?</p>
  <ul className="p-2">
    <li>(a) 8</li>
    <li>(b) 16</li>
    <li>(c) 36</li>
    <li>(d) 54</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because there are 125 equal-sized smaller cubes, n = number of segments on the face of the undivided cube = 5.</p>
  <p>The number of cubes that do not have a painted face = (n - 2)^3 = (5 – 2)^3 = 27.</p>
  <p>Number of only single face painted cubes = (n - 2)^2 × 6 = (5 - 2)^2 × 6 = 54.</p>
  <p>What is Dice? The dice shape is identical to that of a cube or cuboid. At the same time, we can only see three dice views: the front view, the top view, and the side view. Dice is a variation of cubes, but with a little higher logic and conceptual applicability than cubes. Dice is a part of aptitude’s logical reasoning section.</p>
  <p>Dice Types:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Base Dice</li>
    <li>Open Dice</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Base Dice are classified into two types:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Standard Dice</li>
    <li>Ordinary Dice</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Definition of Standard Dice: If the numbers on two dice do not match, they are considered standard dice. The numbers on both dice are not the same. So, we can refer to it as standard dice.</p>
  <p>Definition of Ordinary Dice: When the numbers on two dice match, it is an ordinary dice. Here are two dice, the first with the numbers 2, 3, 4 and the second with the numbers 3, 5, 6. Here, we say that the number 3 is matched. Thus, it is an ordinary dice.</p>
  <p>How to Solve Cube and Dice Questions? Students can use the tips and tactics provided below to assist them in resolving questions relating to the Cube and Dice reasoning section.</p>
  <ol className="p-2">
    <li>In a cube, the length, breadth, and height are equal. There are six surfaces, twelve edges, and eight corners in all.</li>
    <li>Cuboid = the length and breadth of a cuboid are not equal to its height.</li>
    <li>There are two types of dice: Ordinary and Standard Dice.</li>
    <li>It is a standard cube dice with six numbered sides ranging from 1 to 6, having opposite sides adding to 7.</li>
    <li>In standard dice, the “6” is the opposite of 1, the “5” is always the opposite of 2, and the “4” is always the opposite of 3.</li>
    <li>With ordinary dice, the sum of any two adjacent surface values equals 7.</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <p>Deconstructing a Dice: To better understand the theory outlined above, the following diagrams are provided:</p>
  <ol className="p-2">
    <li>E & F are always in opposition to one another, as are all other open dice, whether they are B & F, B & F, or C & D. Both of these surfaces are constantly in the opposite direction of each other.</li>
    <li>Because these two A and C surfaces do not touch each other, they are on opposite sides.</li>
    <li>Here, we notice that B and D are not in contact with one another’s surfaces. Thus, B and D are on opposite sides of one another.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>E is the opposite of F. A is the opposite of C. B is the opposite of D.</p>
  <p>Conclusion: Cube and Dice is a critical chapter of the reasoning aptitude test. Unfortunately, it is hard to visualize dice in three dimensions when dealing with dice. Therefore, we flattened the cube. Dice are formed by placing the farthest end of a flattened cube on top of a central square, which serves as both a cube’s top and its bottom. The remainder of the square represents the dice’s adjacent sides.</p>

        16. Paper Cutting and Folding Test
      </span>

      <div className="p-5 text-lime-950 font-semibold">
        <p>
          The Paper Folding and Cutting involves a process in which a
          transparent sheet is folded and then some cuts and/or folds are made.
          In the questions based on Paper Folding and Cutting a few figures are
          given showing the way in which a piece is to be folded and then cut
          from a particular section. The dotted line is the reference line along
          which the paper is to be folded and the arrow indicates the direction
          of the fold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, these figures indicate the sequence in which the paper is to be
          folded. The designs from the cut will appear on each one of the folds
          made on the paper. In questions based on paper folding and cutting it
          can be asked to find either the folded or unfolded pattern of the
          sheet. Let us see some examples below. We also have some really tricky
          problems that have been put under the higher order thinking section.
